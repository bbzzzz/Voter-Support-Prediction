# Voter-Support-Prediction
This is a project I did for DC based analytics company BlueLabs.

BlueLabs is an analytics, data, and technology company formed by senior members of the Obama for America analytics team. In this project, I built a model that predicts the probability of supporting the Democratic candidate versus the Republican candidate for BlueLabs
