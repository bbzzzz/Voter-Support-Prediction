# Voter-Support-Prediction
This is a project I did for DC based analytics company BlueLabs.

BlueLabs is an analytics, data, and technology company formed by senior members of the Obama for America analytics team. 

In this project, I built a model that predicts voter's probability of supporting the Democratic candidate versus the Republican candidate for BlueLabs.

The main work I did in the process of building the predictive model:
- Missing data imputation
- Feature extraction and feature engineering
- Feature selection
- Parameter tuning using grid search
- Cross validation
- Optimal threshold value selection

Two machine learning models are trained and tested:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting using xgboost
